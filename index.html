      <h1 id='header2'>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p class='pSettings'>Research has shown that 'brain training' games do not significantly improve general cognitive functioning. Is this also true for executive functioning?  Unfortunately, yes. But thankfully, executive functioning is more than an innate aptitude that is resistant to improvement. Instead, it's also a set of concrete skills (i.e., time management, sustained attention, etc.) that can be trained and refined over-time.  Under this premise, this website isn't just another "brain training" scam. Rather, it's useful a tool to help train executive functioning skills to improve your relationships, productivity, and overall life!</p>
